# Hello, :blush:

## So, here's a little bit about me and my knowledge :fire:

My name is Francisco, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics at UFU in Minas Gerais. Some time ago, I discovered that I have a great fascination for Web Development, and since then, I've been studying the main technologies of the market and participating in events to keep myself updated and improve my skills.

As a hobby, I enjoy studying things like embedded systems, compilers, and infrastructure-related subjects in my free time. I find it fascinating to learn about these topics, even though they're not directly related to Web Development.

- Java
- Kotlin
- Spring Framework
- SQL (PostgreSQL and MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- Go
- Python
